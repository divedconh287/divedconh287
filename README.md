- 17 years old (3rd of April).
- Learning C# in school, thus the majority of these projects are for school.
    - If the repository starts with "TE24C" & has the topic "prrprr01" then its for my programming classes.
    - If the repository is called "Lek"-X-"Ã–vning/Uppgift"-X and has the topic "weuweb01" then its for my web development classes.
    - Any other projects are made by my own free will.
